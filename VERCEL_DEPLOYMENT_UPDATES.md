# Vercel Deployment Update Summary

## ðŸ“‹ Changes Made

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

- âœ… **Removed duplicate workflow file** in `evently-frontend/.github/workflows/` 
- âœ… **Added Vercel environment variables** to all Vercel CLI steps
  - Set `VERCEL_ORG_ID` to `team_hsodXjGi5ndO7HPhfmEtYOfF` explicitly
  - Set `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` to `prj_pWg5WKt3iEfrwo6M3jCmSq1IZSad` explicitly
- âœ… **Ensured consistent configuration** across all deployment steps

### 2. Documentation Updates

- âœ… **Updated AUTO_DEPLOY_AKTIF.md** to include Team ID information
- âœ… **Created this summary document** to track changes

## ðŸš€ Deployment Configuration

The workflow now uses the following explicit configuration for all Vercel operations:

```yaml
env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: team_hsodXjGi5ndO7HPhfmEtYOfF
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: prj_pWg5WKt3iEfrwo6M3jCmSq1IZSad
```

Additionally, each Vercel CLI operation (pull, build, deploy) has these environment variables set locally for that step, ensuring they are properly used regardless of workflow-level environment configuration.

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

1. **Push these changes** to the repository
2. **Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow** to confirm successful deployment
3. **Verify in Vercel Dashboard** that deployment is connected to the correct team/project

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If deployment issues persist, try:

1. **Verify Vercel Token**: Ensure the VERCEL_TOKEN secret in GitHub is valid and has permissions for the team.
2. **Check Team Access**: Confirm that the user who generated the Vercel token has access to the specified team.
3. **Project Linking**: You may need to run `vercel link` locally again if project configuration has changed.
4. **Team URL**: The team URL is `wildanus-projects-c54861c9`. Verify this matches what you see in Vercel dashboard.
