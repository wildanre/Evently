# 🚀 CI/CD Deployment Solution

## 🔄 Current Status

**We've simplified the deployment process by using a hybrid approach:**

1. **GitHub Actions** for CI (Continuous Integration)
   - Running tests
   - Type checking
   - Building the application
   - Performance checks (Lighthouse)

2. **Vercel Git Integration** for CD (Continuous Deployment)
   - Automatic deployments from GitHub
   - Preview deployments for pull requests
   - Production deployments for the main branch

## 🛠️ Why This Approach?

The previous workflow attempted to use the Vercel CLI for deployments, which created complexity:

1. **Authentication challenges** with Vercel token and project linking
2. **Coordination issues** between GitHub Actions and Vercel
3. **Redundant build processes** (building in GitHub Actions and again in Vercel)

Our simplified solution leverages the strengths of both platforms:
- GitHub Actions for what it does best: running tests and validating code
- Vercel for what it does best: deploying Next.js applications

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1️⃣ GitHub Actions
When code is pushed or a PR is created:
- Runs all tests
- Performs type checking
- Validates the build
- Runs Lighthouse performance checks on production deployments

### 2️⃣ Vercel Deployments
- **Preview Environments**: Automatically created for every PR
- **Production Deployment**: Automatically triggered when code is merged to main

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

### For Development
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push to GitHub and create a PR
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment
# GitHub Actions automatically runs tests
```

### For Production
```bash
# Merge your PR to main
# OR directly commit to main (not recommended for team work)
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions runs tests
# Vercel automatically deploys to production
```

- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Production URL**: https://evently-nine-iota.vercel.app

## 📋 Requirements

To maintain this workflow, ensure:

1. **GitHub Secrets** are properly configured:
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - DATABASE_URL

2. **Vercel Project Settings**:
   - Connected to GitHub repository
   - Environment variables configured in Vercel Dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail in GitHub Actions:
- Check the GitHub Actions logs
- Fix test issues in your code
- Push changes to trigger a new workflow run

### If Deployment Fails in Vercel:
- Check the Vercel deployment logs in the Vercel Dashboard
- Ensure environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
- Verify that the build process succeeds locally

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Monitor the workflow** with each new PR and merge
2. **Optimize test speed** to improve developer experience
3. **Set up alerts** for failed deployments or tests
